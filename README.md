startgate
=========

The start for all new projects. I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) for all my pre-processing. You can use whatever.

Based on Bitters
================

Startgate is based on [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) by [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/), which in turn relies on [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).
